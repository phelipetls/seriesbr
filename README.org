** Introduction

This package eases the task of getting data from Banco Central do Brasil
(BCB), Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (Ipea) and Instituto 
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) databases.

It has several functions to interact with these databases,
such as searching for a series by name or another criteria,
retrieving metadata and, most importantly,
getting the series values into a `pandas.DataFrame`.

It is heavily inspired by the R packages [[https://github.com/wilsonfreitas/rbcb][rbcb]], [[https://github.com/ipea/ipeaData][ipeaData]] and [[https://github.com/cran/sidrar][sidrar]].
